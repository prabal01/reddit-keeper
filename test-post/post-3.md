# Habitica doesn't work for me.

I am doing it for months now. It is just to do list for me. I am not hooked. Because there is no game play. I get it; it is supposed to be like d&amp;d but I don't see story nor I ever played d&amp;d and tbh I will never emerge myself in it as it seems.

  
Like, it should be something fun.

  
Are there any alternatives?

  I’m building www.focumon.com as kind of an alternative but for a focusing use case. It’s also got a todo list inside : )

    This looks awesome! Are you going to insert more focumons or any kind of procedural generation to give it infinite longevity?

      That sounds like a cool idea! Might come in the future : )

        Thank you. I'm coming in! These tools need something that lasts more time for long therm gamification (Habitica doesn't have this, just raids and pets and it gets boring quickly with no new things to get). Having limited content is lacking for any app where you are supposed to invest the most of the time of your life (you are not going to invest 20-30 hours, like a normal game, but 10.000-1.000.000 hours) 
        
        Thanks for listening

    Great job.
    
    How is it different?
    
    I am digital addict. But big thing for me is listening to podcast and playing video games.
    
    So, if I was doing something like that I would do Habitica but when you get task done, you get points (depending of how hard task is) and you use that points to play actually fun video games (otherwise you can't).

      Totally. Currently it’s a web app in a browser as most of my users work on a laptop. You can install it on your phone as a PWA as well. As for the differentiator, Focumon is built to solve the problem of getting into focus, vs Habitica solves building habits

  I had the same experience; I tried Habitica for a bit, but wanted something with more actually fun gameplay. One approach here, if you enjoy some game design, is to make something for yourself. Choose what you get 'points for,' choose how much a reward (e.g. 30 minutes of video games) costs, and then insert some 'in-between' or mediating factors--like on a given day if you get 5 points, you actually get 6, or if you don't get 7 points in the afternoon, you lose 2 total points (or gold pieces). I have my own home-made, complex, fantasy-themed system that covers most of my life (exercise, hobbies, work, etc.) which I've described it in a few posts and most recently here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GamifyingLife/comments/1cphdx2/what\_does\_your\_personal\_gamification\_system\_look/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamifyingLife/comments/1cphdx2/what_does_your_personal_gamification_system_look/) It really has helped me--someone who will naturally play video games 10 hours a day--to get my shit together.
  
  Think about what you like in video games (randomized loot, levelling up, etc.) and see if you start there for your 'in-between' step.

  Hi, I'm launching a gamified habit tracker and to-do list that actually has an active gameplay soon. Perhaps you can have a look here at [https://tally.so/r/nGl582](https://tally.so/r/nGl582)

      Thanks for letting me know! It's been fixed.

  Hey! I've recently released a gamified approach to achieving goals ([GoalQuest](https://www.goalquestapp.com) -  available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goalquest-daily-goal-quests/id1636884270) and [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fooge.app)). In the app you are taken through daily quests that start from helping you set goals to helping you set challenges to help you make small improvements every day :)

  That’s how it was for me at first. I didn’t really see a point but then I explored the app a bit more and started doing small tasks. Then I joined a party and now I’ve been keeping up with it for months.
