I’m struggling with focus and procrastination, especially when I need to get work done. I know what I need to do, but I often get distracted by YouTube or Netflix and end up wasting time. Even though I plan to be productive, I just can’t pull myself away until something external, like my wife coming back from work, forces me to stop. This pattern of avoiding work and feeling guilty afterwards is frustrating. I am wondering whether this app will help me. Is anybody else like this?

  As someone who has played a lot of videogames, my only issue with Habitica is that I can kind of 'see through the movie magic' in a way. Like, I know gamification techniques so well that I am desensitized to them. 
  
  So, I guess the question is: are you someone who is already desensitized in that way?? If you're not, then I think it could be worth a try. I'd love to hear how it plays out for you!

    well, i didn't understand this fully

      Just try it. If it doesn't work, you haven't lost much at all. Maybe you got a few extra things done before you dropped it. 
      
      If it does work, you've hit the jackpot in life.   
      I found that it works for a while and mostly in a community of a few people on board.

    - **u/MindHiker33** (↑ 0) — *1y ago*
      Haha, well, that's a pretty good sign that you are *not* desensitized to gamification techniques. In which case, Habitica might be immersive and helpful for you!

    It's probably less that you're desensitized to well-executed gamification techniques, and more that Habitica's gamification isn't very ...good once the novelty has worn off

      You might enjoy TaskHero! We've tried hard to make the gamification/progression much more engaging and balanced.

  I have used Habitica and found it somewhat helpful. The "game" part of it isn't overly fleshed out and not terribly motivating in itself, but I found it helpful to have recurring tasks and goals all layed out in one place.
  
  
  The problem is that I spent a lot of time setting up and updating tasks. It became another way to procrastinate. I'm also easily distracted so sometimes pulling out my phone to check something off or see what I should do next would often lead into dinking around on the internet. Writing out simple daily to do lists ended up working better for me.
  
  
  I don't use Habitica anymore, but I enjoyed it and do think that it would be worth checking out if you are interested!

  It didn't work for me. I like games and I really liked the idea and wanted it to work .. but it just isn't that fun to be honest ..
  
  What worked for me was using excel (which could ironically be seen as more "boring" than habitica). It worked because it was a system I can easily use and log and track everything, and my own monthly goals and seeing my progress motivates me more than anything, not other peoples avatars.

    Agree i love mebot finch and forest. And i would day mebot is game changer.

  I used it for a really long time and it work well for me, especially for work tasks. I liked it better when they had forums and guilds to create a more interactive environment, but I think it still has value.

  I did not like habitica, too much excess bullshit. I needed something more minimalistic.

      I am using Loop Habit Tracker rn and I am happy, but thanks for the recommendation

  It didn't work for me for very long, but I also have ADHD, so a lot of systems don't last with me. I think the main reason I didn't stick to it was that I didn't have anyone to play with. My friend joined at first, but she pretty much stopped immediately, leaving me to do joint quests alone. I feel like part of what makes it work for a lot of people is that you can join guilds and parties, so there's other people relying on you to do things for yourself.

  - **u/[deleted]** (↑ 0) — *1y ago*
    A lot of people switch out systems and stop with things that don't seem to benefit them anymore, so you don't need to preface it with everything you struggle to make decisions on based on your ADHD.

    - **u/KatTheKonqueror** (↑ 1) — *1y ago*
      A lot of systems are benefiting me and I drop them anyway. I know when my ADHD is relevant to my experiences, and I will bring it up when it's relevant.

      - **u/[deleted]** (↑ 2) — *1y ago*
        I don't agree with you though, you mentioned it unnecessarily:
        
        &gt;I also have ADHD, so a lot of systems don't last with me
        
        Most people without ADHD don't last long with various systems ***as well*** and switch them out a lot.
        
        &gt;I think the main reason I didn't stick to it was that I didn't have anyone to play with.
        
        Now you're claiming the actual reason you switched it out, which is truthful and good, and this has nothing much to do with ADHD.
        
        You, like many others on reddit wear your diagnosis as a badge of honour/being special, when really you're more normal than you let on.

        - **u/KatTheKonqueror** (↑ 3) — *1y ago*
          You don't know me, and what's really unnecessary is all the assumptions about me, how I view myself, and how I view my diagnosis in your comment.
          
           It's true that there are specific reasons habitica didn't really work for me, but there's also a lot of systems I had that were working that I suddenly stopped. I attribute that to my ADHD because I've seen a ton of other people talk about a similar experience. I brought it up here because even though Habitica wasn't like, say, finch, which I can't really pinpoint a reason I don't stay long even though it seems to be working, it's still part of a pattern.
