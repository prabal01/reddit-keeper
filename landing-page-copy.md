# 🚀 WHY OPINIONDECK EXISTS

Most founders:

* Scroll Reddit for hours
* Open 20 tabs
* Copy-paste into ChatGPT
* Get generic summaries
* Still guess what to build

OpinionDeck structures the chaos.

Instead of reading everything, you extract signal.

Instead of summaries, you get decisions.

---

# 🔄 HOW IT WORKS

From scrolling to strategic clarity — in minutes.

---

## 1️⃣ Install the Extension

OpinionDeck runs in your browser.

When you’re researching competitors, it’s already there — ready to capture signal.

No scripts.
No scraping tools.
No backend queues.

You stay in control.

---

## 2️⃣ Search & Research (Free)

Search a competitor from the homepage
—or browse public discussions naturally.

OpinionDeck surfaces high-signal threads so you don’t waste time on noise.

Exploration is completely free.

---

## 3️⃣ Save High-Signal Threads to Your Deck

Found something valuable?

Click **“Save to Deck.”**

Capture entire discussions for deep signal extraction.

Build your own competitor research folder:

* Complaints
* Feature requests
* Switching posts
* Pricing frustration
* Comparison threads

This becomes your competitive war room.

---

## 4️⃣ Generate Your Competitive Blueprint

When you're ready, click **Run Analysis.**

OpinionDeck scans your selected discussions and extracts:

* 🔴 High-intensity pain points
* 🟠 Switching triggers
* 🟡 Feature gaps competitors ignore
* 🔵 Emotional language patterns
* 🟢 Ranked build priorities
* ⚡ Positioning angles

You don’t get fluff.

You get direction.

---

## 5️⃣ Ship With Leverage

Use your blueprint to:

* Avoid building low-impact features
* Identify underserved segments
* Sharpen your landing page copy
* Improve pricing strategy
* Enter crowded markets confidently

One avoided mistake pays for the tool.

---

# 🎯 WHAT YOU ACTUALLY WALK AWAY WITH

Instead of:

“I think users care about this…”

You get:

“Users repeatedly complain about this. Mentioned in 5 threads. Causing churn.”

Instead of:

“Let’s try this positioning…”

You get:

“Users explicitly say they switched because of this.”

This is competitive leverage.

---

# 👤 WHO THIS IS FOR

✔ Founders validating an idea
✔ SaaS teams preparing to launch
✔ Builders entering competitive markets
✔ Indie hackers who don’t want to guess

If you’re building something completely novel with no competition — this isn’t for you.

If you're entering an existing market — it is.
